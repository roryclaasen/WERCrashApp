# Window Error Reporting Crash App

This is a simple application that crashes on purpose to demonstrate how someone could use the [Windows Error Reporting (WER)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/_wer/) API to report crashes to Watson.

The report being generated can also be viewed via [Windows Event Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/inside/event-viewer) and [Diagnostic Data Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/diagnostic-data-viewer-overview).
